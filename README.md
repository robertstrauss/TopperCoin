## FAQ
 - What is a cryptocurrency?
    A cryptocurrency is a system of money that is <u>entirely digital</u>.
      Payments are recorded securely on a computer, and it's effectively just as real as normal money.
 - How do I use it?
    First, register by creating a username and password,
      and just like that you're ready to send and recieve money, and
      **generate free money by mining.**
      Once you have done that, you can pay anyone else on the network in TPC (TopperCoins).
      Get others you know to join too, so you can pay and get payed by them.
 - What is "mining?"
  "Mining" means getting paid for your computer power.
    More centrally, mining is a key part of how the network works.
    Essentially, by mining your computer is doing many, many calculations very quickly to validate transactions.
    Normally, a hacker might fake a transaction from one user to themselves to take that user's money.
    Mining prevents this by putting a massive computational barrier in the way.
